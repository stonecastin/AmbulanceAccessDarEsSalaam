## Abstract

Ambulance access in Dar Es Slaam, Tanzania based on buildings' distance to nearest passable road and hospital / clinic. Road access ranges from an average (per ward) distance of 75 m to a road  (Kimbiji) to 17 m to a road (Magomeni). Distance to a hospital ranges from an average (per ward) distnce of over 2500 m to a hospital or clinic (Pemba Mnazi) to 208 m average distance to a hospital or clinic (Kisutu).

## Study design

Exploratory study

City of Dar Es Salaam
OSM data collected from 2017 on
Analysis most valid for central city


Is the study **observational**, **exploratory**, or testing one or more **hypotheses**? If testing hypotheses, specify the hypotheses here.

The **spatial extent** of the study is...
The **spatial scale / support** of the study is...
The **temporal extent** of the study is...
The **temporal support** of the study is...

## Materials and procedure

### Data and variables

Roads and polygons (buildings) from OSM used
Wards from Resilience Academy used

Amenity field from polygons to find hospitals / clinics, identify non hospital / clinic buildings
road type from roads to summarize passibility,
wardname from wards

Describe the **data sources** and **variables** to be used.

### Geographic characteristics

Describe the **temporal** and **geographic characteristics** of the study, including its **temporal extent**, **temporal granularity**, **coordinate reference systems** and **spatial extent**. Are there any **edge effects** or complications from integrating data with different **spatial supports** or **resolutions**?

### Data transformations

Describe any **geographic** or **variable** transformations to be applied to data prior to the main analysis (preprocessing steps required to prepare the data for analysis). If any challenges with edge effects or conflicting spatial supports were identified above, enumerate steps to resolve the issues here.

If any data is to be **excluded** from the analysis, explain the rationale and methods for exclusion.

### Analysis

Describe the main analysis of the study, e.g. the steps for testing the hypotheses or answering the main research questions.

## Results

Objectively present the results of the study without additional interpretation.

## Discussion

Provide a summary the key findings of the study along with any limitations or areas in need of further investigation. If the study did not succeed as expected, discuss likely practical procedural and informative causes. Practical procedural causes relate to problems in the research procedures, e.g. challenges with data, code, or research parameters. Informative causes relate to problems with the referent geographic phenomena, e.g. absence of the theorized effect(s), change in population, or change in location.

## Conclusions

What are the broader implications of the research results for the environment or society? Do the results suggest the need for future research?
